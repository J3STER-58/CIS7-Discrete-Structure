P -> Q	<=>	Q' -> P'		Given
P -> Q	<=>	(Q')' v P'	Implication	
P -> Q	<=>	Q v P'	    Double Negation	
P -> Q	<=>	P' v Q	    Commutative	
P -> Q	<=>	P -> Q	    Implication	


				
(P -> R) ^ (Q -> R)	<=>	(P v Q) -> R	  Given	
(P' v R) ^ (Q' v R)	<=>	(P v Q) -> R    Implication	
(P' ^ Q') v R	      <=>	(P v Q) -> R    Distributive	
(P v Q)' v R 	      <=>	(P v Q) -> R    De Morgan's Law	
(P v Q) -> R	      <=>	(P v Q) -> R	  Implication	



(Ǝx)A(x) ^ (Ǝx)B(x) -> (Ǝx)(A(x) ^ B(x))
 x = Plants
 A(x) = are fruit
 B(x) = are vegatables
There exists some plants that are fruits and there exists some plants that are vegetables then their exists some plants that
are fruist and vegetables.
